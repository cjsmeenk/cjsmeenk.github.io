Adam Koberinski's research focuses on the foundations and methodology of frontier physics. He has returned to Western as a posdoctoral fellow after completing his PhD under the supervision of Wayne Myrvold in 2019.  His recent publications regard quantum field theory and cosmology, and earlier papers pursue topics in quantum foundations and spacetime theories as well. During his postdoc he is pursuing projects in the foundations of quantum field theory, early universe cosmology, theory construction in particle physics, and general philosophy of quantum theory. Recently he has shifted from focused case studies to thinking about theory construction, methodology, and dynamic epistemology as more general themes in philosophy of science.  Adam's [webpage](https://adamkoberinski.ca/) includes links to papers, talks, and more information about his ongoing projects.
