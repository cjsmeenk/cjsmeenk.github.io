Heather's research focuses on the epistemic impact of machine learning on scientific practice.  She is currently pursuing a PhD in philosophy clarifying how machine learning can contribute to different aspects of research. Her interest in computational epistemology stems from her M.Sc. in medical physics, where she contributed to the development of an evolutionary optimization algorithm for radiotherapy treatment planning. She also developed computational models of several astrophysical phenomena as part of her B.Sc. in physics and astronomy. Her professional experience as a data analyst and software developer further drives her to reflect on the epistemology of data mining and machine learning. She have gained practical and theoretical knowledge of artificial intelligence by participating in the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) / Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) Deep Learning Reinforcement Learning Summer School 2019.
