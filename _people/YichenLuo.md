Yichen is a PhD student in the Department of Philosophy at Western. Before joining Western, Yichen received a B.Sc in physics at Beijing Normal University and a M.A in philosophy of science at Tsinghua University. His bachelor thesis focused on the foundation of relativity theory, developing an axiomatic system in first-order logic of special relativity theory, and his master thesis proposed a new dynamic account of scientific representation based on a revised model which gained insights from the representation of the Unruh effect in theoretical physics.
