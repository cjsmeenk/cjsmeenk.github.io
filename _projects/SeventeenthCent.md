My main interests in seventeenth century natural philosophy concern how sensory experience contributes to knowledge of nature, and the role of mathematics in enabling this contribution.  I take Newton as introducing a particularly sophisticated and innovative answer to this question, in the form of a kind of quantitative empiricism.  The theoretical framework of the *Principia Mathematica* makes it possible to take aspects of sense experience as measurements of fundamental quantities, such as mass. For example, the length of a particular pendulum measures the surface gravity in the appropriate circumstances. Although "gravity" may be a qualitative feature of ordinary experience, the precise quantitative measure of it is not directly accessible. The contribution sensory experience makes is necessarily theory-mediated, where in this case the relevant theory accounts for the connection between the length of the pendulum bob and the surface gravity. Furthermore, Newton does not, contra contemporaries such as Locke, require that the “fundamental” properties characterizing bodies are manifested as sensible qualities. 

My work in this area has focused primarily on detailed assessment of Newton's methodology, as it is reflected in different aspects of his mathematical physics.  I have benefitted from working in collaboration with [Zvi Biener](http://zbiener.github.io), [Eric Schliesser](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/c/e.s.schliesser/e.s.schliesser.html?cb), and [George E. Smith](https://as.tufts.edu/philosophy/people/faculty/george-smith).
