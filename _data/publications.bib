  abstract = {Inflation remains a promising, yet speculative, account of structure formation in the early universe. In this paper, we provide a general account of what is needed to establish a speculative theory, and apply the account to inflation. Particular challenges for inflation are its flexibility as a phenomenological framework, and the lack of empirical access to test seemingly independent features of specific realizations of inflation. This makes it difficult to leverage initial empirical successes to learn further physical details about the inflationary epoch. One prima facie appealing response is to treat phenomenological accounts of inflation as effective field theories (EFTs), screening off details of higher-energy physics. We argue that inflation is a poor fit into the EFT framework due to its sensitivity to high-energy physics. We close by stating specific recommendations to take steps towards establishing inflation as part of a theory of the early universe that follow from our approach.}

	date = {2023},
	abstract = {This article highlights some interesting foundational and philosophical issues made salient in early universe cosmology. One major focus is on issues that arise at the boundaries of distinct theories or frameworks, when trying to merge them for describing the early universe. These include issues at the boundary of gravity and statistical physics, as well as gravity and quantum field theory. These foundational issues arise in trying to unify distinct domains of physics. Another major theme of early universe cosmology is the methodological goal of finding dynamical explanations for striking features in the universe. This review surveys many examples of such a methodology---including the cosmic arrow of time, posits of a Past Hypothesis for the initial state of the universe, inflation, baryogenesis, and emergence of spacetime. There is much philosophical debate about the prospects for success of such a methodology; these are surveyed below.}

This chapter reviews aspects of these debates from a historical perspective, beginning with debates about whether the uniqueness of the universe implies that cosmology needs a distinctive methodology. Underdetermination of theory by the evidence is particularly challenging due to horizons and inaccessible physics. Theories of the ‚Äòorigin‚Äô of the universe do not have the same structure as other physical theories. Recent debates have focused on how to evaluate theories that predict a multiverse, in particular regarding the significance of fine-tuning and how to conduct anthropic reasoning.}

The origins of these basic cosmological problems are described. The dark matter must be non-baryonic, but its nature has not been established. Likewise, the nature of the dark energy is not understood. The inflationary model for the very early universe has had some undoubted successes in accounting for the initial power-spectrum of fluctuations from which large-scale structures formed but there is no physical realization of the inflaton field. Defects formed during phase transitions in the early universe cannot account for the initial power spectrum of fluctuations, but may have some part to play in structure formation. The origin of the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the early universe is not understood in terms of theories of particle physics.}

abstract="Observational astronomy is plagued with selection effects that must be taken into account when interpreting data from astronomical surveys. Because of the physical limitations of observing time and instrument sensitivity, datasets are rarely complete. However, determining specifically what is missing from any sample is not always straightforward. For example, there are always more faint objects (such as galaxies) than bright ones in any brightness-limited sample, but faint objects may not be of the same kind as bright ones. Assuming they are can lead to mischaracterizing the population of objects near the boundary of what can be detected. Similarly, starting with nearby objects that can be well observed and assuming that objects much farther away (and sampled from a younger universe) are of the same kind can lead us astray. Demographic models of galaxy populations can be used as inputs to observing system simulations to create ``mock'' catalogues that can be used to characterize and account for multiple, interacting selection effects. The use of simulations for this purpose is common practice in astronomy, and blurs the line between observations and simulations; the observational data cannot be interpreted independent of the simulations. We will describe this methodology and argue that astrophysicists have developed effective ways to establish the reliability of simulation-dependent observational programs. The reliability depends on how well the physical and demographic properties of the simulated population can be constrained through independent observations. We also identify a new challenge raised by the use of simulations, which we call the ``problem of uncomputed alternatives.'' Sometimes the simulations themselves create unintended selection effects when the limits of what can be simulated lead astronomers to only consider a limited space of alternative proposals.",

Finally, the search for proper Noether energy-momentum tensors is put into context with recent claims that Noether‚Äôs theorem and its converse make statements on equivalence classes of symmetries and conservation laws. The aim is to identify clearly the limitations of this latter move, and to develop this position by contrast with recent philosophical discussions about how symmetries relate to the representational capacities of theories.}}

We propose an alternative path of structured code validation that applies eliminative reasoning to isolate and reduce possible sources of error, a potential path that is already being explored by some cosmologists.}}

We provide a systematic assessment of the often implicit philosophical assumptions guiding the methodology of precision cosmology in relation to dark energy. We start by briefly introducing a recent account of scientific progress in terms of risky and constrained lines of inquiry. This allows us to contrast aspects of {\Lambda} that make it relevantly different from other theoretical entities in science, such as its remoteness from direct observation or manipulability. We lay out a classification for possible ways to explain apparent accelerated expansion but conclude that these conceptually clear distinctions may blur heavily in practice. Finally, we consider the important role played in cosmology by critical tests of background assumptions, approximation techniques, and core principles, arguing that the weak anthropic principle fits into this category. We argue that some core typicality assumptions--such as the Copernican principle and the cosmological principle--are necessary though not provable, while others--such as the strong anthropic principle and appeals to naturalness or probability in the multiverse--are not similarly justifiable.}}

Recent observations in cosmology indicate a tension between ‚Äúlocal‚Äù and ‚Äúglobal‚Äù determinations of the Hubble constant. Here I argue that this tension illustrates one of the benefits of taking the model seriously and consider the challenges to making a case for the permanence of {\Lambda}CDM.}}

We then take an external view, showing that the assumptions for using EFTs are violated in general relativistic domains where {\Lambda} is relevant. We highlight some ways forward that do not depend on naturalness.}}
